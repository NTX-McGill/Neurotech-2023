# Backend

- Create a virtual environment on your machine using the file [Requirements](/backend/requirements.txt) and activate it.
- Set the time in milliseconds in line 147 of [Get Data](/backend/plotData/brainflowGetData.py) which will tell the backend how long you want to record for. 
- Navigate to the frontend folder and run the command `npm start` to start the frontend.
- Run the python file from the terminal by `$ python brainflowGetData.py`.
- Go to the frontend and hit the start button to display words. The recording will automatically.
