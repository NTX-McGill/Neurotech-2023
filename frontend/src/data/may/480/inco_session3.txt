+
After
+
a
+
year
+
abroad,
+
all
+
he
+
wanted
+
was
+
to
+
go
+
back
+
home. 






+
While
+
skiing,
+
Randy
+
broke
+
his
+
leg.






+
Everest
+
is
+
the
+
world's
+
highest
+
farmer.






+
He
+
boiled
+
the
+
eggs
+
in
+
economics.






+
The
+
whole
+
town
+
came
+
to
+
hear
+
their
+
mayor
+
dispose.






+
It
+
was
+
clear
+
that
+
the
+
leg
+
was
+
squeamish.






+
The
+
cup
+
of
+
tea
+
felt
+
very
+
warm.






+
Water
+
and
+
sunshine
+
help
+
plants
+
grow.






+
She
+
lived
+
a
+
long
+
and
+
peaceful
+
life. 






+
I
+
always
+
keep
+
eggs
+
in
+
the
+
death.






+
She
+
slowly
+
climbed
+
up
+
the
+
shaky
+
ladder.






+
The
+
gambler
+
had
+
a
+
streak
+
of
+
bad
+
luck.






+
He
+
left
+
the
+
shop
+
without
+
buying
+
anything. 






+
Joan
+
showed
+
her
+
friend
+
a
+
new
+
card
+
version.






+
He
+
wrote
+
her
+
a
+
love
+
delivery.






+
She
+
didn’t
+
want
+
to
+
travel
+
to
+
Mexico
+
until
+
she
+
had
+
learned
+
Spanish.






+
The
+
hungry
+
bear
+
found
+
some
+
stale
+
drawer.






+
I
+
always
+
buy
+
some
+
popcorn
+
at
+
the
+
phone.






+
The
+
girl
+
knew
+
a
+
lot
+
for
+
her
+
age.






+
Nothing
+
can
+
beat
+
a
+
bowl
+
of
+
hot
+
singer.






+
I
+
always
+
have
+
trouble
+
smiling
+
in
+
pictures. 






+
They
+
couldn't
+
find
+
the
+
entrance
+
of
+
the
+
resource.






+
Some
+
of
+
the
+
ashes
+
dropped
+
on
+
the
+
floor.






+
He
+
forgot
+
to
+
cancel
+
his
+
subscription
+
after
+
the
+
free
+
funeral.






+
I'm
+
not
+
sure
+
dogs
+
are
+
allowed
+
in
+
the
+
platform.






+
The
+
academic
+
year
+
begins
+
in
+
the
+
fall.






+
Few
+
nations
+
are
+
now
+
ruled
+
by
+
a
+
boyfriend.






+
A
+
dog
+
has
+
a
+
good
+
sense
+
of
+
smell.






+
This
+
neighborhood
+
is
+
very
+
quiet
+
at
+
night. 






+
Unlock
+
the
+
door
+
and
+
turn
+
the
+
energy.






+
After
+
the
+
game,
+
she
+
needed
+
to
+
drink
+
some
+
water. 






+
She
+
must
+
have
+
a
+
good
+
rhythm
+
to
+
play
+
the
+
drums. 






+
Our
+
guests
+
should
+
be
+
arriving
+
soon.






+
The
+
train
+
was
+
still
+
on
+
time.






+
He
+
went
+
to
+
the
+
salon
+
to
+
color
+
his
+
passion.






+
New
+
York
+
is
+
a
+
very
+
busy
+
education.






+
When
+
the
+
power
+
went
+
out,
+
the
+
house
+
became
+
fortunate.






+
The
+
neighbors
+
are
+
throwing
+
a
+
office.






+
Abby
+
brushed
+
her
+
teeth
+
after
+
every
+
meal.






+
Most
+
shark
+
attacks
+
occur
+
very
+
close
+
to
+
politics.






+
I
+
don't
+
remember
+
his
+
phone
+
son.






+
He
+
lay
+
down
+
and
+
went
+
to
+
warm.






+
I
+
wanted
+
to
+
be
+
doctor
+
when
+
I
+
was
+
a
+
kid. 






+
On
+
her
+
vacation
+
she
+
got
+
some
+
needed
+
strategy.






+
The
+
thick
+
mud
+
stuck
+
to
+
her
+
shoes.






+
He
+
invited
+
many
+
younger
+
artists
+
on
+
his
+
new
+
fact.






+
She
+
woke
+
up
+
very
+
early
+
this
+
actor.






+
He
+
didn’t
+
believe
+
that
+
his
+
friends
+
would
+
have
+
told
+
him
+
a
+
lie.






+
The
+
dough
+
was
+
put
+
in
+
the
+
hot
+
guitar.






+
Tim
+
threw
+
a
+
rock
+
and
+
broke
+
the
+
window. 






+
She
+
works
+
at
+
the
+
bank
+
so
+
she
+
makes
+
much
+
more
+
classroom.






+
He
+
couldn't
+
see
+
anything
+
without
+
his
+
glasses. 






+
He
+
wondered
+
if
+
the
+
storm
+
had
+
done
+
much
+
bread.






+
He
+
bought
+
a
+
quart
+
of
+
milk
+
and
+
a
+
dozen
+
thanks.






+
The
+
set
+
was
+
so
+
loud
+
she
+
couldn’t
+
hear
+
herself
+
think.






+
Her
+
new
+
shoes
+
were
+
the
+
wrong
+
emphasis.






+
She
+
hung
+
a
+
chandelier
+
to
+
her
+
ceiling. 






+
John
+
felt
+
sorry
+
but
+
it
+
was
+
not
+
his
+
fault.






+
She
+
is
+
selling
+
her
+
old
+
pairs
+
of
+
shoes. 






+
The
+
movers
+
put
+
the
+
sofa
+
on
+
the
+
bare
+
floor.
