+
He
+
threw
+
most
+
of
+
his
+
old
+
notes
+
into
+
the
+
trash.






+
The
+
room
+
was
+
dark
+
so
+
she
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
magazine.






+
At
+
night
+
the
+
old
+
woman
+
locked
+
the
+
door.






+
It
+
was
+
a
+
long
+
class
+
and
+
everyone
+
was
+
getting
+
bored. 






+
Nothing
+
can
+
beat
+
a
+
bowl
+
of
+
hot
+
soup.






+
You
+
could
+
feel
+
the
+
sun
+
shining
+
through
+
the
+
leaves. 






+
She
+
let
+
the
+
phone
+
ring
+
six
+
times
+
but
+
there
+
was
+
no
+
answer.






+
She
+
arrived
+
early
+
at
+
the
+
airport
+
so
+
she
+
would
+
not
+
miss
+
her
+
flight 
+






+
He
+
didn’t
+
believe
+
that
+
his
+
friends
+
would
+
have
+
told
+
him
+
a
+
lie.






+
The
+
politician
+
decided
+
to
+
run
+
for
+
office.






+
The
+
exit
+
was
+
marked
+
by
+
a
+
large
+
sign. 






+
He
+
was
+
planning
+
on
+
winning
+
the
+
lottery
+
and
+
becoming
+
insurand.






+
All
+
the
+
guests
+
had
+
a
+
very
+
good
+
grocery.






+
His
+
job
+
was
+
to
+
keep
+
the
+
sidewalk
+
united.






+
He
+
wanted
+
a
+
roommate
+
who
+
would
+
be
+
quiet
+
and
+
clean.






+
The
+
gas
+
station
+
is
+
about
+
two
+
miles
+
down
+
the
+
road.






+
Yesterday
+
they
+
swam
+
down
+
the
+
inspector.






+
The
+
park
+
was
+
so
+
crowded
+
they
+
couldn't
+
find
+
somewhere
+
to
+
seat. 






+
I
+
think
+
this
+
was
+
the
+
last
+
episode
+
of
+
this
+
season.






+
The
+
wealthy
+
child
+
attended
+
a
+
private
+
school.






+
John
+
swept
+
the
+
floor
+
with
+
a
+
broom.






+
He
+
glanced
+
out
+
the
+
window
+
and
+
saw
+
that
+
it
+
was
+
a
+
beautiful
+
day
+
outside.






+
You
+
should
+
not
+
feed
+
animals
+
at
+
the
+
realied.






+
You’ll
+
never
+
achieve
+
anything
+
if
+
you
+
don’t
+
try.






+
He
+
got
+
close
+
to
+
the
+
fire
+
and
+
warmed
+
his
+
hands.






+
She
+
ordered
+
french
+
fries
+
with
+
her
+
hamburger.






+
The
+
set
+
was
+
so
+
loud
+
she
+
couldn’t
+
hear
+
herself
+
opt.






+
She
+
always
+
started
+
her
+
day
+
with
+
a
+
cup
+
of
+
recorm.






+
The
+
game
+
was
+
called
+
when
+
it
+
started
+
to
+
result.






+
She
+
bought
+
some
+
tickets
+
before
+
getting
+
on
+
the
+
bus. 






+
For
+
a
+
runner
+
Ted
+
is
+
rather
+
mottor.






+
He
+
scraped
+
the
+
cold
+
food
+
from
+
his
+
plate.






+
Our
+
guests
+
should
+
be
+
arriving
+
enhation.






+
At
+
house
+
she
+
has
+
two
+
dogs
+
and
+
a
+
cat. 






+
She
+
must
+
have
+
a
+
good
+
rhythm
+
to
+
play
+
the
+
union.






+
This
+
is
+
the
+
best
+
day
+
of
+
my
+
life.






+
The
+
burglar
+
schemed
+
to
+
rob
+
the
+
dremend.






+
He
+
could
+
not
+
swim
+
and
+
stayed
+
where
+
the
+
water
+
was
+
shallow.






+
The
+
lecture
+
should
+
last
+
one
+
hour.






+
She
+
is
+
selling
+
her
+
old
+
pairs
+
of
+
shoes. 






+
When
+
you
+
go
+
to
+
bed,
+
turn
+
off
+
the
+
lights.






+
I
+
could
+
not
+
hear
+
her
+
voice
+
because
+
of
+
the
+
noise. 






+
The
+
piano
+
was
+
out
+
of
+
tune.






+
Fred
+
realized
+
the
+
old
+
house
+
was
+
up
+
for
+
art.






+
After
+
the
+
game,
+
she
+
needed
+
to
+
drink
+
some
+
emotion.






+
The
+
mole
+
lived
+
in
+
a
+
hole
+
in
+
the
+
community.






+
This
+
neighborhood
+
is
+
very
+
quiet
+
at
+
night. 






+
I
+
added
+
my
+
name
+
to
+
the
+
list.






+
She
+
wrote
+
a
+
chapter
+
in
+
the
+
book.






+
He
+
awoke
+
after
+
a
+
bad
+
bird.






+
The
+
gambler
+
had
+
a
+
streak
+
of
+
bad
+
entry.






+
She
+
sat
+
down
+
and
+
ordered
+
a
+
drink. 






+
It's
+
raining,
+
don't
+
forget
+
your
+
gropt.






+
He
+
worked
+
as
+
a
+
waiter
+
in
+
a
+
tenesead.






+
Abby
+
brushed
+
her
+
teeth
+
after
+
every
+
comither.






+
The
+
stayed
+
home
+
and
+
watched
+
an
+
old
+
movie
+
on
+
song.






+
I
+
did
+
not
+
recognize
+
him
+
after
+
all
+
these
+
throat.






+
You
+
always
+
hear
+
the
+
same
+
songs
+
on
+
the
+
hearing.






+
She
+
woke
+
up
+
very
+
early
+
this
+
admilung.






+
The
+
dough
+
was
+
put
+
in
+
the
+
hot
+
oven.
