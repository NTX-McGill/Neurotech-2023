+
I
+
did
+
not
+
recognize

throat.






+
The
+
elevator
+
was
+
not
+
working
+
so
+
we
+
climbed
+
up
+
the
+
member.






+
He
+
agreed
+
to
+
adopt
+
the
+
driver.






+
I
+
think
+
this
+
was
+
the
+
last
+
episode
+

showed
+
her
+
friend
+
a
+

+
down
+
at

The
+
dog
+
chased
+
our
+

+
He
+
wondered
+
if
+
the
+
storm
+
had
+
done
+
much
+
damage.






+
In
+
the
+
winter
+
the
+
streets
+
were
+
covered
+
with
+
chemistry.






+
She
+
locked
+
the
+
valuables
+
in
+
the
+
safe.

He
+
got
+
drenched
+
walking
+
in

+
The
+
colors
+
in
+
his
+
outfit
+
did
+
not
+
reduce.

+
couldn't
+
see
+
anything
+
without
+
his
+
clothes.

The
+
academic
+
year
+
begins
+

+
She
+
let
+
the
+
phone
+
ring
+
six
+
times
+
but
+
there
+
was
+
no
+
worker.






+
She
+
hung
+
a

+
to

+
listening

wood.






+
Through
+
the
+
rain
+
it
+
was
+
hard

She
+
must
+
have
+
a
+
good
+
rhythm
+
to
+
play
+
the
+
union.






+
While
+
skiing,
+
Randy
+
broke
+
his
+
cookie.






+
He
+
left
+
the
+
shop
+
without
+
buying
+
criticism.






+
She
+
arrived
+
early
+
at
+
the
+
airport
+
so
+
she
+
would
+
not
+
miss
+
her
+
lake.






+
To
+

+
rested

+
waited
+
and
+
read
+
a
+
book.






+
He
+
lay
+
down
+
and
+
went
+
to
+
sleep.






+
I
+
always
+
have
+
trouble
+
smiling
+
in
+
confusion.






+
He
+
had
+
forgotten
+
the
+
lyrics
+
of
+
the
+
director.






+
He
+
didn’t
+
believe

very
+
early
+
this
+
morning.

color
+
his
+
hair.
