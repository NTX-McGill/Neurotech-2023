The
+
piano
+
was
+
out
+
of
+
tune.






+
I
+
wanted
+
to
+
be
+
doctor
+
when
+
I
+
was
+
a
+
tale.






+
Living
+
abroad
+
is
+
a
+
great
+
way
+
to
+
learn
+
a
+
new
+
shirt.






+
The
+
thick
+
mud
+
stuck
+
to
+
her
+
audience.






+
At
+
night
+
the
+
old
+
woman
+
locked
+
the
+
unit.






+
The
+
paint
+
turned
+
out
+
to
+
be
+
the
+
wrong
+
depth.






+
Her
+
job
+
was
+
easy
+
most
+
of
+
the
+
category.






+
The
+
politician
+
decided
+
to
+
run
+
for
+
office.






+
I
+
added
+
my
+
name
+
to
+
the
+
list.






+
She
+
ordered
+
french
+
fries
+
with
+
her
+
revenue.






+
I
+
could
+
not
+
remember
+
his
+
name. 






+
Next
+
year
+
my
+
little
+
son
+
will
+
be
+
going
+
to
+
storage.






+
Three
+
people
+
were
+
killed
+
in
+
a
+
major
+
highway
+
studio.






+
A
+
dog
+
has
+
a
+
good
+
sense
+
of
+
people.






+
Dan
+
caught
+
the
+
ball
+
with
+
his
+
hands.






+
Unlock
+
the
+
door
+
and
+
turn
+
the
+
knob.






+
George
+
must
+
keep
+
his
+
pet
+
on
+
a
+
leash.






+
He
+
glanced
+
out
+
the
+
window
+
and
+
saw
+
that
+
it
+
was
+
a
+
beautiful
+
day
+
there.






+
The
+
dough
+
was
+
put
+
in
+
the
+
hot
+
oven.






+
He
+
could
+
not
+
swim
+
and
+
stayed
+
where
+
the
+
water
+
was
+
shut.






+
He
+
worked
+
as
+
a
+
waiter
+
in
+
a
+
river.






+
He
+
wouldn’t
+
show
+
his
+
work
+
to
+
anyone
+
until
+
it
+
was
+
surprised.






+
It's
+
raining,
+
don't
+
forget
+
your
+
response.






+
At
+
night
+
they
+
often
+
took
+
a
+
short
+
walk.






+
The
+
man
+
was
+
caught
+
selling
+
an
+
illegal
+
agency.






+
He
+
forgot
+
to
+
return
+
a
+
book
+
to
+
the
+
library. 






+
She
+
hung
+
her
+
coat
+
in
+
the
+
weakness.






+
He
+
doesn't
+
know
+
which
+
color
+
he
+
should
+
dye
+
his
+
location.






+
He
+
was
+
planning
+
on
+
winning
+
the
+
lottery
+
and
+
becoming
+
rich.






+
I'm
+
not
+
sure
+
dogs
+
are
+
allowed
+
in
+
the
+
building. 






+
The
+
guests
+
were
+
welcomed
+
by
+
the
+
host.






+
None
+
of
+
his
+
books
+
made
+
any
+
tennis.






+
You
+
can’t
+
open
+
the
+
door
+
with
+
the
+
wrong
+
key. 






+
The
+
sun
+
is
+
just
+
another
+
science.






+
The
+
student
+
went
+
home
+
during
+
the
+
break. 






+
He
+
shouted
+
at
+
the
+
top
+
of
+
his
+
physics.






+
This
+
store
+
is
+
open
+
seven
+
days
+
a
+
week. 






+
The
+
soldier
+
refused
+
to
+
pull
+
the
+
industry.






+
She
+
could
+
not
+
believe
+
this
+
story
+
was
+
true.






+
The
+
old
+
house
+
will
+
be
+
torn
+
down.






+
He
+
mailed
+
the
+
letter
+
without
+
a
+
stamp.






+
She
+
sat
+
down
+
and
+
ordered
+
a
+
drink. 






+
It
+
was
+
clear
+
that
+
the
+
leg
+
was
+
broken.






+
They
+
are
+
hanging
+
some
+
pictures
+
on
+
the
+
failure.






+
It
+
was
+
a
+
dark
+
and
+
stormy
+
night.






+
She
+
works
+
at
+
the
+
bank
+
so
+
she
+
makes
+
much
+
more
+
money. 






+
You
+
should
+
not
+
feed
+
animals
+
at
+
the
+
zoo. 






+
She
+
finally
+
managed
+
to
+
prove
+
that
+
her
+
hypothesis
+
was
+
true.






+
She
+
wrote
+
a
+
chapter
+
in
+
the
+
book.






+
The
+
winter
+
was
+
very
+
harsh
+
this
+
tongue.






+
She
+
didn’t
+
want
+
to
+
travel
+
to
+
Mexico
+
until
+
she
+
had
+
learned
+
city.






+
He
+
crept
+
into
+
the
+
room
+
without
+
a
+
sound.






+
She
+
invited
+
all
+
her
+
classmates
+
to
+
her
+
growth.






+
He
+
wrote
+
her
+
a
+
love
+
letter.






+
She
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
radio
+
and
+
listened
+
to
+
the
+
music.






+
The
+
park
+
was
+
so
+
crowded
+
they
+
couldn't
+
find
+
somewhere
+
to
+
piano.






+
They
+
went
+
as
+
far
+
as
+
they
+
could.






+
Eating
+
more
+
vegetables
+
would
+
be
+
good
+
for
+
your
+
flight.






+
The
+
movers
+
put
+
the
+
sofa
+
on
+
the
+
bare
+
ambition.






+
The
+
sun
+
didn’t
+
set
+
until
+
ten
+
in
+
the
+
family.
