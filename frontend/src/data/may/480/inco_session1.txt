+
The
+
tailor
+
began
+
to
+
fix
+
the
+
suit.






+
He
+
bought
+
a
+
quart
+
of
+
milk
+
and
+
a
+
dozen
+
eggs.






+
They
+
left
+
the
+
dirty
+
dishes
+
in
+
the
+
income.






+
She
+
cleaned
+
the
+
dirt
+
from
+
her
+
heart.






+
After
+
speaking
+
she
+
left
+
the
+
noisy
+
blood.






+
New
+
York
+
is
+
a
+
very
+
busy
+
city.






+
John
+
felt
+
sorry
+
but
+
it
+
was
+
not
+
his
+
dad.






+
At
+
house
+
she
+
has
+
two
+
dogs
+
and
+
a
+
writer.






+
It’s
+
hard
+
to
+
admit
+
when
+
one
+
is
+
wrong.






+
They
+
asked
+
him
+
to
+
play
+
tennis
+
but
+
he
+
was
+
too
+
tired.






+
He
+
almost
+
got
+
lost
+
driving
+
home
+
because
+
it
+
was
+
so
+
zesty.






+
The
+
bill
+
was
+
due
+
at
+
the
+
end
+
of
+
the
+
recipe.






+
The
+
children
+
went
+
outside
+
to
+
play.






+
They
+
planted
+
a
+
tree
+
in
+
their
+
garden.






+
She
+
bought
+
some
+
tickets
+
before
+
getting
+
on
+
the
+
thought.






+
Her
+
new
+
shoes
+
were
+
the
+
wrong
+
size.






+
She
+
always
+
started
+
her
+
day
+
with
+
a
+
cup
+
of
+
food.






+
The
+
interview
+
went
+
well
+
and
+
she
+
got
+
the
+
artisan.






+
His
+
job
+
was
+
to
+
keep
+
the
+
sidewalk
+
clean.






+
The
+
player
+
scored
+
and
+
was
+
cheered
+
by
+
the
+
whole
+
stadium. 






+
During
+
the
+
volley,
+
he
+
twisted
+
his
+
truth.






+
Without
+
her
+
efforts,
+
her
+
team
+
would
+
not
+
have
+
won
+
the
+
extent.






+
They
+
made
+
camp
+
just
+
before
+
sunset.






+
The
+
loaf
+
was
+
eaten
+
except
+
for
+
a
+
small
+
piece.






+
Even
+
for
+
an
+
amateur,
+
he
+
was
+
pretty
+
good. 






+
The
+
whole
+
town
+
came
+
to
+
hear
+
their
+
mayor
+
speak.






+
The
+
captain
+
wanted
+
to
+
stay
+
with
+
the
+
sinking
+
ship.






+
The
+
room
+
was
+
dark
+
so
+
she
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
magazine.






+
The
+
boat
+
passed
+
easily
+
under
+
the
+
aspect.






+
He
+
used
+
to
+
drive
+
a
+
very
+
small
+
car.






+
He
+
wanted
+
a
+
roommate
+
who
+
would
+
be
+
quiet
+
and
+
callous.






+
When
+
the
+
two
+
met,
+
one
+
of
+
them
+
held
+
out
+
his
+
arrival.






+
When
+
the
+
power
+
went
+
out,
+
the
+
house
+
became
+
dark.






+
His
+
speech
+
lasted
+
only
+
five
+
historian.






+
He
+
invited
+
many
+
younger
+
artists
+
on
+
his
+
new
+
album. 






+
Vic
+
asked
+
her
+
to
+
repeat
+
what
+
she
+
had
+
equipped.






+
The
+
children
+
held
+
their
+
hands
+
and
+
formed
+
a
+
circle.






+
She
+
is
+
selling
+
her
+
old
+
pairs
+
of
+
events.






+
He
+
threw
+
most
+
of
+
his
+
old
+
notes
+
into
+
the
+
agreement.






+
All
+
the
+
guests
+
had
+
a
+
very
+
good
+
time.






+
The
+
food
+
was
+
delicious,
+
I
+
will
+
come
+
back. 






+
This
+
is
+
the
+
best
+
day
+
of
+
my
+
life.






+
She
+
wanted
+
to
+
donate
+
some
+
money.






+
The
+
surgeon
+
trained
+
vainly
+
to
+
save
+
his
+
patient.






+
Take
+
your
+
shoes
+
off,
+
I
+
just
+
cleaned
+
the
+
floor. 






+
He
+
forgot
+
to
+
cancel
+
his
+
subscription
+
after
+
the
+
free
+
trial. 






+
The
+
burglar
+
schemed
+
to
+
rob
+
the
+
bank.






+
Few
+
nations
+
are
+
now
+
ruled
+
by
+
a
+
king.






+
You
+
don't
+
need
+
this
+
coat,
+
it's
+
really
+
warm
+
college.






+
The
+
exit
+
was
+
marked
+
by
+
a
+
large
+
sign. 






+
The
+
game
+
was
+
called
+
when
+
it
+
started
+
to
+
result.






+
The
+
puppy
+
chewed
+
on
+
the
+
airport.






+
This
+
jacket
+
was
+
more
+
expensive
+
than
+
I
+
thought.






+
Nothing
+
can
+
beat
+
a
+
bowl
+
of
+
hot
+
soup.






+
He
+
got
+
close
+
to
+
the
+
fire
+
and
+
warmed
+
his
+
hands.






+
He
+
awoke
+
after
+
a
+
bad
+
dream.






+
Ho
+
loosened
+
the
+
tie
+
around
+
his
+
history.






+
After
+
the
+
game,
+
she
+
needed
+
to
+
drink
+
some
+
emotion.






+
I
+
could
+
not
+
hear
+
her
+
voice
+
because
+
of
+
the
+
noise. 






+
I
+
would
+
like
+
to
+
open
+
the
+
door
+
but
+
I
+
forgot
+
my
+
insect.
