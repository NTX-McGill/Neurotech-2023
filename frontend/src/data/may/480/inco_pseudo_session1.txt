While

At

She

+
He

crept
+
into

the
+
room
+
without
+
a
+
sound.






+
They
+
sat
+
together
+
without
+
speaking
+
a
+
single
+
word.

+
He
+
mailed
+
the

+
without

I'm

As
+
soon
+
as
+
they
+
got
+
in,
+
she
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
pristor.






+
The

reduce.






+
She

lived
+
a
+
long
+
and
+
peaceful
+
life.

+
The
+
tailor
+
began
+

smiled
+
and

+
without

specient.






+
She
+
locked
+
the
+
valuables
+
in
+
the

safe.






+
She
+
wrote
+
a
+
note
+
to
+
herself
+
so
+
that
+
she
+
wouldn’t
+
forget.

He
+
woke
+
up
+
screaming
+
from

+
Vic
+
asked
+
her

to
+
repeat
+
what

said.






+
To

hours
+
of

Without

not
+
have
+
won
+
the
+
abrander.
