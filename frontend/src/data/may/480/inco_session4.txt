+
The
+
rude
+
waiter
+
was
+
not
+
given
+
a
+
decision.






+
Three
+
people
+
were
+
killed
+
in
+
a
+
major
+
highway
+
accident.






+
The
+
watchdog
+
gave
+
a
+
warning
+
growl.






+
He
+
dried
+
the
+
bowls
+
with
+
a
+
property.






+
The
+
paint
+
turned
+
out
+
to
+
be
+
the
+
wrong
+
color.






+
The
+
tailor
+
began
+
to
+
fix
+
the
+
assistant.






+
Yesterday
+
they
+
swam
+
down
+
the
+
river.






+
She
+
wanted
+
to
+
donate
+
some
+
loss.






+
The
+
captain
+
wanted
+
to
+
stay
+
with
+
the
+
sinking
+
addition.






+
She
+
wanted
+
to
+
find
+
the
+
owner
+
of
+
the
+
dog
+
she
+
had
+
listened.






+
The
+
ducks
+
swam
+
around
+
the
+
bedroom.






+
He
+
agreed
+
to
+
adopt
+
the
+
child.






+
The
+
game
+
was
+
called
+
when
+
it
+
started
+
to
+
rain.






+
The
+
stayed
+
home
+
and
+
watched
+
an
+
old
+
movie
+
on
+
TV.






+
He
+
woke
+
up
+
screaming
+
from
+
a
+
bad
+
potato.






+
The
+
player
+
scored
+
and
+
was
+
cheered
+
by
+
the
+
whole
+
midnight.






+
He
+
quickly
+
became
+
the
+
best
+
chess
+
player
+
in
+
the
+
world. 






+
He
+
always
+
plays
+
his
+
favorite
+
intention.






+
As
+
soon
+
as
+
they
+
got
+
in,
+
she
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
lights.






+
She
+
bought
+
some
+
tickets
+
before
+
getting
+
on
+
the
+
bus. 






+
He
+
doesn't
+
know
+
which
+
color
+
he
+
should
+
dye
+
his
+
hair. 






+
I
+
think
+
this
+
was
+
the
+
last
+
episode
+
of
+
this
+
season.






+
To
+
feel
+
rested
+
I
+
need
+
at
+
least
+
eight
+
hours
+
of
+
mud.






+
He
+
mailed
+
the
+
letter
+
without
+
a
+
wedding.






+
Without
+
her
+
efforts,
+
her
+
team
+
would
+
not
+
have
+
won
+
the
+
game. 






+
The
+
burglar
+
schemed
+
to
+
rob
+
the
+
proposal.






+
He
+
shouted
+
at
+
the
+
top
+
of
+
his
+
lungs.






+
The
+
sun
+
is
+
just
+
another
+
star.






+
The
+
loaf
+
was
+
eaten
+
except
+
for
+
a
+
small
+
internet.






+
Eating
+
more
+
vegetables
+
would
+
be
+
good
+
for
+
your
+
health. 






+
I
+
could
+
not
+
hear
+
her
+
voice
+
because
+
of
+
the
+
region.






+
He
+
threw
+
most
+
of
+
his
+
old
+
notes
+
into
+
the
+
trash.






+
The
+
park
+
was
+
so
+
crowded
+
they
+
couldn't
+
find
+
somewhere
+
to
+
seat. 






+
She
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
radio
+
and
+
listened
+
to
+
the
+
library.






+
At
+
night
+
they
+
often
+
took
+
a
+
short
+
policy.






+
Bill
+
played
+
music
+
too
+
loyally.






+
The
+
old
+
house
+
was
+
built
+
entirely
+
of
+
fish.






+
The
+
room
+
was
+
dark
+
so
+
she
+
turned
+
on
+
the
+
lights.






+
At
+
night
+
the
+
old
+
woman
+
locked
+
the
+
door.






+
At
+
night
+
I
+
lie
+
down
+
on
+
the
+
grass
+
and
+
look
+
at
+
the
+
hotel.






+
Ho
+
loosened
+
the
+
tie
+
around
+
his
+
neck.






+
The
+
teacher
+
wrote
+
the
+
problem
+
on
+
the
+
homework.






+
They
+
were
+
startled
+
by
+
the
+
sudden
+
situation.






+
After
+
speaking
+
she
+
left
+
the
+
noisy
+
room.






+
She
+
ordered
+
french
+
fries
+
with
+
her
+
hamburger.






+
He
+
smiled
+
and
+
sat
+
down
+
at
+
the
+
table.






+
None
+
of
+
his
+
books
+
made
+
any
+
sense.






+
She
+
finally
+
got
+
the
+
job
+
of
+
her
+
selection.






+
You
+
could
+
feel
+
the
+
sun
+
shining
+
through
+
the
+
leaves. 






+
Everyone
+
wanted
+
the
+
war
+
to
+
be
+
over. 






+
This
+
jacket
+
was
+
more
+
expensive
+
than
+
I
+
ate.






+
I
+
could
+
not
+
remember
+
his
+
chest.






+
He
+
had
+
forgotten
+
the
+
lyrics
+
of
+
the
+
song.






+
The
+
children
+
went
+
outside
+
to
+
police.






+
After
+
dinner
+
they
+
washed
+
the
+
dishes.






+
The
+
man
+
was
+
caught
+
selling
+
an
+
illegal
+
drug.






+
This
+
shop
+
usually
+
closes
+
pretty
+
venomous.






+
This
+
is
+
the
+
best
+
day
+
of
+
my
+
person.






+
They
+
asked
+
him
+
to
+
play
+
tennis
+
but
+
he
+
was
+
too
+
orange.






+
The
+
food
+
was
+
delicious,
+
I
+
will
+
come
+
close.
