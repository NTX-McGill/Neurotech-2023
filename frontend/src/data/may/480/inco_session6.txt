+
He
+
used
+
to
+
drive
+
a
+
very
+
small
+
contract.






+
The
+
student
+
went
+
home
+
during
+
the
+
honey.






+
Fred
+
realized
+
the
+
old
+
house
+
was
+
up
+
for
+
art.






+
Take
+
your
+
shoes
+
off,
+
I
+
just
+
cleaned
+
the
+
pie.






+
The
+
child
+
was
+
born
+
with
+
a
+
rare
+
accident.






+
This
+
video
+
game
+
has
+
a
+
lot
+
of
+
positive
+
reviews. 






+
The
+
puppy
+
chewed
+
on
+
the
+
bone.






+
The
+
old
+
house
+
will
+
be
+
torn
+
warmly.






+
The
+
bill
+
was
+
due
+
at
+
the
+
end
+
of
+
the
+
month.






+
The
+
room
+
feels
+
empty,
+
I
+
should
+
add
+
some
+
teaching.






+
He
+
almost
+
got
+
lost
+
driving
+
home
+
because
+
it
+
was
+
so
+
foggy.






+
I
+
would
+
like
+
to
+
open
+
the
+
door
+
but
+
I
+
forgot
+
my
+
keys. 






+
The
+
elevator
+
was
+
not
+
working
+
so
+
we
+
climbed
+
up
+
the
+
stairs. 






+
The
+
teacher
+
planned
+
to
+
grade
+
the
+
tests.






+
They
+
went
+
as
+
far
+
as
+
they
+
grew.






+
He
+
wanted
+
a
+
roommate
+
who
+
would
+
be
+
quiet
+
and
+
clean.






+
The
+
piano
+
was
+
out
+
of
+
series.






+
The
+
lecture
+
should
+
last
+
one
+
hour.






+
He
+
saw
+
the
+
light
+
at
+
the
+
end
+
of
+
the
+
height.






+
The
+
sun
+
didn’t
+
set
+
until
+
ten
+
in
+
the
+
evening.






+
Her
+
job
+
was
+
easy
+
most
+
of
+
the
+
time.






+
He
+
wanted
+
to
+
ask
+
so
+
many
+
questions. 






+
His
+
job
+
was
+
to
+
keep
+
the
+
sidewalk
+
united.






+
She
+
sat
+
down
+
and
+
ordered
+
a
+
departure.






+
The
+
guests
+
were
+
welcomed
+
by
+
the
+
language.






+
She
+
cleaned
+
the
+
dirt
+
from
+
her
+
shoes.






+
Vic
+
asked
+
her
+
to
+
repeat
+
what
+
she
+
had
+
said.






+
It’s
+
hard
+
to
+
admit
+
when
+
one
+
is
+
knotty.






+
She
+
hung
+
her
+
coat
+
in
+
the
+
closet.






+
He
+
glanced
+
out
+
the
+
window
+
and
+
saw
+
that
+
it
+
was
+
a
+
beautiful
+
day
+
outside.






+
When
+
you
+
go
+
to
+
bed,
+
turn
+
off
+
the
+
poet.






+
It
+
was
+
a
+
long
+
class
+
and
+
everyone
+
was
+
getting
+
false.






+
He
+
waited
+
and
+
read
+
a
+
penalty.






+
The
+
interview
+
went
+
well
+
and
+
she
+
got
+
the
+
job.






+
THey
+
wanted
+
their
+
parents
+
to
+
come
+
ahead.






+
I
+
can't
+
go
+
anywhere
+
without
+
listening
+
to
+
music.






+
He
+
got
+
drenched
+
walking
+
in
+
the
+
rain. 






+
It
+
was
+
a
+
dark
+
and
+
stormy
+
ability.






+
The
+
soldier
+
refused
+
to
+
pull
+
the
+
trigger.






+
They
+
planted
+
a
+
tree
+
in
+
their
+
menu.






+
Lois
+
is
+
taller
+
than
+
most
+
girls.






+
She
+
could
+
not
+
believe
+
this
+
story
+
was
+
acidic.






+
It's
+
summer,
+
I
+
would
+
like
+
to
+
go
+
outside. 






+
Through
+
the
+
rain
+
it
+
was
+
hard
+
to
+
see
+
the
+
story.






+
She
+
always
+
started
+
her
+
day
+
with
+
a
+
cup
+
of
+
coffee. 






+
I
+
added
+
my
+
name
+
to
+
the
+
mall.






+
They
+
raised
+
pigs
+
on
+
their
+
farm.






+
The
+
exit
+
was
+
marked
+
by
+
a
+
large
+
concept.






+
You
+
should
+
not
+
feed
+
animals
+
at
+
the
+
alcohol.






+
You
+
always
+
hear
+
the
+
same
+
songs
+
on
+
the
+
radio.






+
She
+
wrote
+
a
+
chapter
+
in
+
the
+
effort.






+
You
+
don't
+
need
+
this
+
coat,
+
it's
+
really
+
warm
+
outside.






+
He
+
was
+
planning
+
on
+
winning
+
the
+
lottery
+
and
+
becoming
+
pure.






+
Squirrels
+
forget
+
where
+
they
+
hide
+
their
+
nuts. 






+
The
+
pizza
+
was
+
too
+
hot
+
to
+
eat. 






+
The
+
colors
+
in
+
his
+
outfit
+
did
+
not
+
match. 






+
All
+
the
+
guests
+
had
+
a
+
very
+
good
+
grocery.






+
The
+
dispute
+
was
+
settled
+
by
+
a
+
third
+
party.






+
He
+
crept
+
into
+
the
+
room
+
without
+
a
+
mom.

Most
+
cats
